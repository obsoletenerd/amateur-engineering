# AmateurEngineering

http://www.amateurengineering.com/

An open-source multi-user blog/zine for makers and hackers that pulls posts from contributing members personal project blogs to include them in a shared community. Our hope is that decreasing the friction for members to contribute to this site will help in both directions, promoting the idea of personal digital gardens at the same time as having a community of like-minded hobbyists sharing projects with each other and the general public.

## Contributing Content

If you're a maker/hacker/etc, you can add your blog to the site by adding your RSS feed to the `feeds.json` file. We pull the post info from your RSS feed then aggregate it with all the other members, creating a single place to see all the updated blogs. A simplified RSS reader focussed on a specific topic.

Don't have a personal project blog? Personal blogs have never been easier and later-you will thank now-you for logging your progression and development. Even a free GitHub Pages site using Jekyll is a great way to get started and takes 15 minutes to set up.
