      "summary": "Firnsy from the Ballarat Hackerspace is developing a badge for BSides Ballarat 2026, and I thought it would be fun to add some SAOs for it.\nI have a few ideas, but I thought I&rsquo;d start small and get something out the door, before committing to larger ideas.\nSAO Basics\nA SAO in this context is a &ldquo;Simple Add-On&rdquo;, a small PCB that can be added to an existing board to provide additional functionality.\nThe &ldquo;spec&rdquo; is very simple - six pins in a 2x3 header, with VCC, GND, I...",

The only identifying label is on the bottom of the keyboard, which was made by Nan Tan Computer Co in Taiwan, but there is no record of them ever making desktop PCs. The keyboard is the exact same blue as the rest of the PC so was clearly along with the rest of the machine.",

      "summary": "Today the Australian Signals Directorate announced their 75th Anniversary Commemorative Coin, which is a standard Australian 50 cent coin with various cryptographic puzzles embedded in it. I'm not a cryptography expert, but I've always loved this stuff from the sidelines of physical pentesting and teen-years script-kiddying, so I thought I'd give it a go. Along with a mate in our local Hackerspace's slack channel, we started bouncing ideas back and forth, and below is a write-up of the eventual ...",

I found some existing projects that require cutting up the Gameboy, or modifying it in various ways... or some products from overseas that cost a fair bit and are basically just a LiPo + controller jammed into the battery cavity. I wanted something that didn't require any modification to the original Gameboy, and could be swap...",

      "summary": "This is a very basic beginner-friendly project that gives a physical volume knob that works on most desktop/laptops. Using a rotary encoder, a Digispark microcontroller, a few soldered wires, some pre-existing firmware from Adafruit, and a 3D printed housing, we get a super tidy and tiny dial for controlling the system volume (or map it to whatever you want). It plugs directly into the side of my laptop into the USB port, or you can use it via a USB extension cable to place it on your desk.",

Jitsi is basically Zoom but with less spyware and more \"it crashes lots and has lots of bugs but it's Open Source so we convince ourselves it's worth it anyway\".
