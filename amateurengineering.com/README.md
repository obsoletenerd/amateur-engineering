# Amateur Engineering

Amateur Engineering is a multi-user blog of makers/hackers/DIYers sharing projects they're working on.

This blog is a bit different to most in a technical way though, as it is actually a static site compiled from the individual personal blogs of the members. The aim is to create a central community that helps bring eyes to the content of the members, while still letting everyone have their own personal websites and fully control their own content.

We're big believers in the old-web and the benefits of having your own domain, your own website, and control over the content you choose to publish online.

New members are always welcome. If you're a maker/hacker/tinkerer of any kind, from electronics to woodworking and everything in between, add your blog to the members.yaml file in this repo or [contact us](https://www.amateurengineering.com/contact) for help and/or more information.
