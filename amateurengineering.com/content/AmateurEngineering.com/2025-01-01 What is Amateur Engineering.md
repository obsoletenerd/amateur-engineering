Amateur Engineering is the act of building stuff for the sake of building stuff, rather than because you were paid to do it for someone else. Putting as much effort and skill as you can into making a project for no other reason than to see it made. Whether it's custom PCBs for a personal project, wood and metal fabrication done in your shed, or software projects coded to scratch that 2am idea-itch. You might consider yourself a maker, a hacker, a tinkerer, an inventor, an artist, or just someone who likes to create stuff for fun.

AmateurEngineering.com is an old-school blog done in a very new-school way. Our posts are pulled from our membership pool, where each member has their own website/blog and the content is then fed into the belly of the beast and compiled into a single community where everyone can see what everyone else is up to. It's a way to share personal projects with the group while also sharing it with the world, but still maintaining full control over your own content and not having to worry about submitting it to more than one site.
